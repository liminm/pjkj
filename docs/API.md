{
  "valid": <boolean>,
  "reason": "<string>"
}
```

### Get past & new Events

This is the complicated part. In order to be notified of all events happening
in the game, a comet-style [Server-Sent-Event (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)
feed is opened via this GET request and _stays open_, feeding back data in the
SSE format. This means that as soon as, say, another player makes a move, you
will be notified of that move and can start yours.

```javascript
GET /api/game/<GameId>/events

200 OK
data: {
  "type": "move" || "gameEnd" || "serverMessage",
  "player": "playerA" || "playerB" || null,
  "timestamp": "<string iso utc>",
  "details": {
    "move": "<string uci (a1b2; e7e8q; 0000)>",
    "postFEN": "<string fen after move>",
    "time": <int ms>
  } || {
    "type": "win" || "surrender" || "draw" || "timeout" || "timeBudget" || "50move" || "repState",
    "winner": "playerA" || "playerB" || "draw"
  } || {
    "messageText": "<string>"
  }
}

: heartbeat     // every couple of seconds the server will send these to ensure
                // the connection is still alive and close it otherwise.
                // Please ignore lines starting with a colon (':') (see SSE).

data: ...
```
